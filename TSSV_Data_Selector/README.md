# Time Synchronised Sampled Value (TSSV) Data Selector

TSSV Data Selector is intended for use of continuous TSSV files produced
by OpenPMU devices.  It will also work on such files produced by other devices
using the same TSSV file format and data structure (i.e. WAVE and FLAC).

Usage:
* Place all the files to be plotted in one directory with no other files.
* Set "start_time" and "duration_ms"
* Run code
